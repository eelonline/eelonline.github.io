this is the github version of the site the main one can be found at www.eelonline.us
if your browser says its not secure then it does not do bryan
this is mostly an extra site that i use sometimes for news incoming games and other crap
because i use a linux server for the main one and this one is apperantly more stable im not sayin' the other one is crap im saying that this is linked to the main site like github makes it linked to the site somehow idk how but it automaticly displays links its pretty cool tho main one is pretty cool
